    <h1 style="text-align:center;""font-family:cursive;">Why Did I Choose This Class?</h1>
    <p style="text-align:center;""font-family:fantasy;">For about half of my life, maybe more maybe less, I have been surrounded by technology. It was a way of entertainment for me and my family. Ever since about 5 years ago, I have always wanted to create something of my own, using technology like computers. My Dad also wanted to take classes in computer science but didn't meet the needed requirements. To me, technology is a growing way to make everyone's lives better and easier. However, there are many things that I still need to learn to even do anything. Eventualy, I also wanted to get a career involving computers or any technology. Once I heard that there was a class in Computer Science here, I instantly wanted to know more. So here I am, finally sitting in the place that will be my first step toward my goal in using technology to make life better.</p>
